I do not necessarily see the need for such frivoly but I will play the good student and much to my surprise, I like the old man, he has much knowledge and is willing to share it.<br>If this is to be my record of my time here the I will start with getting accepted. I was deep in the forest of <a data-href="Jakunta" href="01-dungeons-and-dragons\campaigns\2025-campaign\03-locations\jakunta.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Jakunta</a> hunting for some of the rare spell components that can be found in this uniquely magical forest. While wandering I encountered many <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="blood-hawk" data-href="blood-hawk" href="01-dungeons-and-dragons\cli\bestiary\beast\blood-hawk.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Blood Hawk</a>s in the area and was very wary of attacks from the sky, I think that is why I noticed the bird straight away. He dove out of the sky with letter clamped in talon, I took the note from bird and sent it on its way. Havin received my admission letter, my plan could begin. I immediately turned toward the direct of school and started my long journey.<br>Many days later I arrived on campus, fortunately on very first day of school. Approaching such a creation of foot is a wonder to behold, the entire campus floating in the air suspended by magic that has been lost for so long. Once on grounds, I was led to the <a data-href="Dorms" href="Dorms" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Dorms</a>, which also house the <a data-href="Dinning Hall" href="Dinning Hall" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Dinning Hall</a>, and was sat at the first year table, where I was slowly introduced to my new companions. I do not remember who came in when, but slowly all of my fellows took their seats at the table with me. <a data-href="Gregor" href="01-dungeons-and-dragons\campaigns\2025-campaign\02-npcs\gregor.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Gregor</a> and I kept mostly to ourselves but we did make note of the large <a data-href="dragonborn" href="01-dungeons-and-dragons\cli\races\dragonborn.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">dragonborn</a>, I now know that to be <a data-href="Balgor" href="01-dungeons-and-dragons\campaigns\2025-campaign\02-npcs\balgor.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Balgor</a>, who sat next to us. <a data-href="Sylva" href="01-dungeons-and-dragons\campaigns\2025-campaign\02-npcs\sylva.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Sylva</a> did try to start up some conversation but none of us were much for it. <br>As dinner came to an end, we new students were asked to stay behind, as everyone left, for some ground rules and introductions. After the hall emptied out except for <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Thaldor Coldforce" data-href="Thaldor Coldforce" href="01-dungeons-and-dragons\campaigns\2025-campaign\02-npcs\thaldor-coldforce.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Thaldor</a>, he started to give us some basic introductions and guidelines of life here. However, he suddenly gasped and looked up into the rafters of the room. We all turned to see what he was looking at. I have seen some large spiders in my day, this made those look reasonable. The spider dropped down from the rafters and landed on a table in the center of the room. We immediately started trying to dispatch the creature but did have some struggles with doing so. I'm not proud to say that I spend a large portion of the fight caught in some web it threw my way. I did notice one of my new friends, <a data-href="Orianna" href="01-dungeons-and-dragons\campaigns\2025-campaign\01-player-characters\orianna.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Orianna</a>, snuck off and managed to pick the entry door. I will have to keep these skills in mind for some... future needs.<br><a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Thaldor Coldforce" data-href="Thaldor Coldforce" href="01-dungeons-and-dragons\campaigns\2025-campaign\02-npcs\thaldor-coldforce.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Thaldor</a> appeared back in the room and calmed the spider before we fully killed it, apparently this is some type of hazing that they do for all new students. I don't know how I feel about that but it is good to know we will be expected to overcome challenges on our own, might make the staff look the other way to students taking matters into their own hands. <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Thaldor Coldforce" data-href="Thaldor Coldforce" href="01-dungeons-and-dragons\campaigns\2025-campaign\02-npcs\thaldor-coldforce.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Thaldor</a> then finished up his introduction by telling us we will face many challenges like this during our time here at the school and he looks forward to us finding our way here at <a data-href="Cinderwind College" href="01-dungeons-and-dragons\campaigns\2025-campaign\03-locations\cinderwind-college.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Cinderwind College</a>.<br>Finally I was able to leave the dinning hall and we were shown to our new quarters for our residency. They were nothing special but they are a great deal better than sleeping under a tree or rock ledge. Gregor, damn the softy, immediatly settled in and got comfortable. I will have to make sure he does not slack too much. On the bed in my room I did find an envelope with some interesting tokens inside. However, as i poured them out into my hand they immediately seemed to evaporate. As they did so, I felt my connection to the weave strengthen. I immediately tried to cast one of the spells I had been experimenting with and found that where it had previously been failing, it now could sustain itself and form succesfully. I am very intrigued to see what is going on at this school and to find what secrets it is hiding.<br><br>Summary:: In this session, the character reflects on their acceptance into Cinderwind College, detailing their arrival on campus, an introduction dinner where they encountered a giant spider as part of a hazing ritual, and the discovery of a mysterious envelope that enhances their magical abilities.

<br><br><br>Today was the first day of classes. It started with breakfast in the student building, and then a couple hours of free time. We all decided to go out and explore campus which meant we all followed <a data-href="Fenna" href="01-dungeons-and-dragons\campaigns\2025-campaign\01-player-characters\fenna.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Fenna</a> to the <a data-href="Chapel" href="Chapel" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Chapel</a>. There we met <a data-href="Brad" href="01-dungeons-and-dragons\campaigns\2025-campaign\02-npcs\brad.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Brad</a>, I do not like Brad. What kind of god asks you to worship them while naked, what is the point? The weave does not care about stage of undressed so why should the gods.<br>
The session started with a quick breakfast followed by a 2 hour free period and then our first class, Alchemy.<br>
For the free period, we headed over to the temple because <a data-href="Fenna" href="01-dungeons-and-dragons\campaigns\2025-campaign\01-player-characters\fenna.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Fenna</a> needed to take time with her god. We all kind of scoped out the place and then were approached by <a data-href="Brad" href="01-dungeons-and-dragons\campaigns\2025-campaign\02-npcs\brad.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Brad</a>. Brad is a typical hippie and patron of the goddess of love. After talking with the gals for a minute he headed over and prayed to his goddess, naked.<br>
From there we headed over to the Wizard and Alchemy tower for our first Alchemy class. In this class we met the professor, [need to get name], and got started on potions. We split up into groups of 2 and each picked a different potion to make. I paired up with <a data-href="Orianna" href="01-dungeons-and-dragons\campaigns\2025-campaign\01-player-characters\orianna.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Orianna</a> and we decided to make a <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="potion-of-healing" data-href="potion-of-healing" href="01-dungeons-and-dragons\cli\items\potion-of-healing.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Potion of Healing</a>. We succeeded!<br>
After this, I stuck around the Wizard and Alchemy tower and looked around to see what all was in the building. The first floor was mostly classrooms, the second floor had more classrooms as well as a practice room with dummies for assumedly casting spells on. There was a third floor but it seems to be a single classroom as they had the stairs roped off with a sign that said "Class in Progress".<br>
We then headed over to the lunch hall and had a quick and uneventful lunch from which we headed over to the Student center. We met <a data-href="Soup" href="01-dungeons-and-dragons\campaigns\2025-campaign\02-npcs\soup.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Soup</a>, the <a data-href="goblin" href="01-dungeons-and-dragons\cli\bestiary\humanoid\goblin.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">goblin</a> server. He started hooking us up with some drinks before he was interrupted by a 4-th year student <a data-href="need to get name" href="need to get name" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">need to get name</a> who stumbled in drunk and challenged 4 people to beer-pong. The 4 of us took him up on it and got our butt's kicked as everyone but <a data-href="Fenna" href="01-dungeons-and-dragons\campaigns\2025-campaign\01-player-characters\fenna.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Fenna</a> proceeded to get drunk. We then slept off our stupor on the bean-bags in the student hall.<br>
We were then awoken by shouts and yelling from the stables. We rush out to help where we find that the animals(a <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="griffon" data-href="griffon" href="01-dungeons-and-dragons\cli\bestiary\monstrosity\griffon.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Griffon</a>, <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="01 - Dungeons and Dragons/CLI/bestiary/legendary-group/unicorn" data-href="01 - Dungeons and Dragons/CLI/bestiary/legendary-group/unicorn" href="01-dungeons-and-dragons\cli\bestiary\legendary-group\unicorn.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Unicorn</a>, <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="owlbear" data-href="owlbear" href="01-dungeons-and-dragons\cli\bestiary\monstrosity\owlbear.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Owlbear</a>, and 3 <a data-href="almiraj" href="almiraj" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">almiraj</a>) have escaped from their pens. <br><br><br><br><br>]]></description><link>01-dungeons-and-dragons\campaigns\2025-campaign\00-session-notes\session-2.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">01 - Dungeons and Dragons/Campaigns/2025 Campaign/00 - Session Notes/Session 2.md</guid><pubDate>Fri, 11 Jul 2025 14:29:34 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Downtime]]></title><description><![CDATA[

They very generally pass around the idea of breaking into the faculty offices to see what they are hiding there. Vladik knows he has a plan but doesn't want to worry Orianna.<br>
In addition to this, he also tries to get to know the new teacher this year <a data-href="Mirabelle" href="Mirabelle" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Mirabelle</a>. He has already seen she is willing to talk about the secrets of the school, maybe he can get more out of her.<br>
Finally, while Vladik is not concerned with the school itself or what if stands for, he is blown away at the progress he has already made and wants to get to the bottom of how the school is able to advance people abilities so far beyond what is normally achievable. He can be seen around campus and in the dorms at time deep in a book or writing notes to himself in his journal. Vla<br>
Occasionally he plays fetch with Gregor. Gregor doesn't know why he loves it but he does.]]></description><link>01-dungeons-and-dragons\campaigns\2025-campaign\00-session-notes\session-2.5.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">01 - Dungeons and Dragons/Campaigns/2025 Campaign/00 - Session Notes/Session 2.5.md</guid><pubDate>Mon, 17 Mar 2025 12:48:29 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Session 3]]></title><description><![CDATA[

Having narrowly avoided disaster, the pair continue on their way. After failing to remember that <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="thaumaturgy" data-href="thaumaturgy" href="01-dungeons-and-dragons\cli\spells\thaumaturgy.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Thaumaturgy</a> can unlock doors and unsuccessfully picking the lock, they finally make it into the offices. <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Vladik Shadewrought" data-href="Vladik Shadewrought" href="01-dungeons-and-dragons\campaigns\2025-campaign\01-player-characters\vladik-shadewrought.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Vladik</a> first walks over to <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Thaldor Coldforce" data-href="Thaldor Coldforce" href="01-dungeons-and-dragons\campaigns\2025-campaign\02-npcs\thaldor-coldforce.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Thaldor</a>'s room and knocks to see if the professor is in. <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Thaldor Coldforce" data-href="Thaldor Coldforce" href="01-dungeons-and-dragons\campaigns\2025-campaign\02-npcs\thaldor-coldforce.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Thaldor</a> welcomes <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Vladik Shadewrought" data-href="Vladik Shadewrought" href="01-dungeons-and-dragons\campaigns\2025-campaign\01-player-characters\vladik-shadewrought.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Vladik</a>, looking like <a data-href="Ax Tabor" href="01-dungeons-and-dragons\campaigns\2025-campaign\02-npcs\ax-tabor.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Ax Tabor</a>, into his office and begins to discuss. <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Vladik Shadewrought" data-href="Vladik Shadewrought" href="01-dungeons-and-dragons\campaigns\2025-campaign\01-player-characters\vladik-shadewrought.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Vladik</a> was hoping he was out so he panics and leaves rather quickly.<br>
Deciding they have taken enough risk the pair begin to leave when <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Thaldor Coldforce" data-href="Thaldor Coldforce" href="01-dungeons-and-dragons\campaigns\2025-campaign\02-npcs\thaldor-coldforce.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Thaldor</a> exits his office. He then heads down a different hallway which has a single door at the far end.

He splits us off into 2 groups, casters (Vladik, Fenna, and Orianna) and non-casters (Balgor, Sylva, and Alice). The goal is just to show off what you can do with magic. The caster group does almost nothing with their magic either not working how they intended or not working at all. On the other hand, Alice discovers that she can cast magic innately and moves to join the caster group. <br>The group heads out of the class toward the center of campus, as they walk they are discussing Alice's new revelation. Upon reaching the plaza, the group finds <a data-href="Sylva" href="01-dungeons-and-dragons\campaigns\2025-campaign\02-npcs\sylva.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Sylva</a> cornering <a data-href="Brad" href="01-dungeons-and-dragons\campaigns\2025-campaign\02-npcs\brad.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Brad</a> and asking about magic and where it comes from. She seems to grow increasingly heated and begins yelling. Suddenly, magic seems to fall off of her and she no longer looks like herself, but like a large <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="goblin-mpmm" data-href="goblin-mpmm" href="01-dungeons-and-dragons\cli\races\goblin-mpmm.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Goblin</a>. The group immediately begins to try to subdue the new foe, who has managed to knock out Brad and is seemingly getting ready to engage with anyone around.<br>
After a short fight with many Magic Missiles from both Vladik and Alice, as well as more goblins appearing from around the area, the first-years manage to take out the backup and restrain the main Goblin for questioning. His name is <a data-href="get-name-from-adam" href="get-name-from-adam" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">get-name-from-adam</a> and he was sent here by a <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="frost-giant" data-href="frost-giant" href="01-dungeons-and-dragons\cli\bestiary\giant\frost-giant.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Frost Giant</a> named <a data-href="Vulkara" href="01-dungeons-and-dragons\campaigns\2025-campaign\02-npcs\vulkara.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Vulkara</a>. Vulkara is looking for the source of magic she seems to think is located at <a data-href="Cinderwind College" href="01-dungeons-and-dragons\campaigns\2025-campaign\03-locations\cinderwind-college.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Cinderwind College</a>. <a data-href="get-name-from-adam" href="get-name-from-adam" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">get-name-from-adam</a> does not provide any further information to the group and <a data-href="Alice" href="01-dungeons-and-dragons\campaigns\2025-campaign\01-player-characters\alice.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Alice</a> kills him. <br>After the groups close encounter, <a data-href="Arith" href="01-dungeons-and-dragons\campaigns\2025-campaign\02-npcs\arith.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Arith</a> arrives on the scene and sees the group of first-years surrounded by dead goblins and an unconscious <a data-href="Brad" href="01-dungeons-and-dragons\campaigns\2025-campaign\02-npcs\brad.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Brad</a>. He seems fairly upset by the events he sees and send the students back to their dorm. At the dorm the group decide to look in Sylva's room to see if they find any clues as to where she is. Instead they find Sylva, tied up and gagged on her bed. After making sure that she is okay, they begin to ask her some questions to figure out what happened.<br>
She left campus 2 weeks ago to head home after not having the best first week on campus. On the way, it seems like she was attacked and kidnapped by this group of goblins and thrown in a bag. They brought her back to campus and used her knowledge to disguise themselves as her and go to her classes. She doesn't know much else than that because they kept her hidden away so the group leaves her alone. As they get ready to leave, <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Vladik Shadewrought" data-href="Vladik Shadewrought" href="01-dungeons-and-dragons\campaigns\2025-campaign\01-player-characters\vladik-shadewrought.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Vladik</a> notices a bag on her bed and asks if its hers and if he can take a look. She says that's fine, and after picking it up and looking, he realizes he is holding a <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="bag-of-holding" data-href="bag-of-holding" href="01-dungeons-and-dragons\cli\items\bag-of-holding.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Bag of Holding</a>. Vladik, who's goal is to find and study the magic that the campus holds, does not share this knowledge with the group out of concern for relenting the bag. <br>All the first years head to their rooms where they find notes from <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Thaldor Coldforce" data-href="Thaldor Coldforce" href="01-dungeons-and-dragons\campaigns\2025-campaign\02-npcs\thaldor-coldforce.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Thaldor</a> commending them on their show of skills today but also warning them to consider their actions before jumping into situations.<br><br>Vladik and Orianna successfully sneak into the faculty offices and snoop around. The first-years are put through their first practical magic class with Thaldor where Alice discovers she is more intune with the weave than she first thought. Finally the group discovers Sylva was turned into a Goblin!! Just kidding, a goblin had been using magic for the last week to look like her and try to infiltrate Cinderwind. After dispatching the goblin and finding out some interesting information about who sent him the group heads back to the dorms and tries to help Sylva. <br><br>

<br><br><br>The session started the morning after the fight with <a data-href="Sylva Goblin" href="Sylva Goblin" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Sylva Goblin</a>. As we all awoke and came out into the common area we saw a note hung on the notice board that said "Students are to meet in the dinning hall at 9:30am for message from faculty.". We took a few minutes before heading out to discuss the events of the day before and what they might mean for us and campus. <a data-href="Balgor" href="01-dungeons-and-dragons\campaigns\2025-campaign\02-npcs\balgor.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Balgor</a> seemed to be pretty angry and after asking, he revealed that he was upset at either himself or all of us for not realizing <a data-href="Sylva" href="01-dungeons-and-dragons\campaigns\2025-campaign\02-npcs\sylva.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Sylva</a> was a goblin for 2 whole weeks.

As it falls from the ceiling and hits the floor the students decide to engage with it. They quickly learn to not pierce it or hit it with lightning as these both seem to make it split instead of hurting it. The group now has to deal with 4 smaller puddings that are causing damage to not only them, but their gear as well. Then as the combat seems to be slowing, a second pudding appears from down the hall and begins attacking <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Vladik Shadewrought" data-href="Vladik Shadewrought" href="01-dungeons-and-dragons\campaigns\2025-campaign\01-player-characters\vladik-shadewrought.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Vladik</a>. <br>After dealing with all the monsters; <a data-href="Trevalia" href="01-dungeons-and-dragons\campaigns\2025-campaign\02-npcs\trevalia.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Trevalia</a>, <a data-href="Sabrina" href="Sabrina" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Sabrina</a>, <a data-href="Katie" href="01-dungeons-and-dragons\campaigns\2025-campaign\02-npcs\katie.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Katie</a>, and <a data-href="Katy" href="Katy" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Katy</a> all come up the stairs.

<br><br>After reading the letter and making sure it was not dangerous, the group decided to approach <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Thaldor Coldforce" data-href="Thaldor Coldforce" href="01-dungeons-and-dragons\campaigns\2025-campaign\02-npcs\thaldor-coldforce.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Thaldor</a> and get more information about the letter. Instead of approaching the topic directly, the 3 ladies decided to approach the topic in a roundabout way and tried to figure out if Thaldor could be trusted. As the group started to leave and regroup, Vladik decided to slip the letter to Thaldor as they left. <br>Upon receiving the letter and reading it Thaldor sat the group down and explained some of what he knew. He told the students that security didn't use to be an issue on campus. There were not attacks or break ins, it was pretty safe. This year has been different and the faculty has started upping security to prevent issues.  He also gave us a lot of information about <a data-href="Vulkara" href="01-dungeons-and-dragons\campaigns\2025-campaign\02-npcs\vulkara.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Vulkara</a>, she was a student at Cinderwind almost 100 years ago. She was the first Eldritch Knight that Thaldor ever met and had a large appetite for magic. Eventually she became frustrated at the slow pace that the college was able to handout advancements and process. After filling us in, he told us that he would meet us later in the colosseum to show us something.<br>We killed some time after this meeting and then proceeded to the colosseum. As we arrived, we see, chained down in the center of the arena, a large Ice Giant. Thaldor seems to be drugged out and fretting around the giant. He goes on to explain that he wanted to give us some up close interaction with a Frost Giant so we would know what we are dealing with with Vulkara. <br>Suddenly the giant broke one of his chains and threw Thaldor out of the arena, we then started to try and subdue the giant ourselves.<br><br>Summary:: In Session 5, the group approached Thaldor Coldforce to gather information about a mysterious letter they had found. Instead of directly addressing the letter, they sought to ascertain Thaldor's trustworthiness, while Vladik discreetly slipped the letter to him as they left. Thaldor shared insights about recent security concerns on campus and recounted the story of Vulkara, a former student and the first Eldritch Knight, who became frustrated with the college's slow pace in magic advancements. He later invited the group to the colosseum for an up-close encounter with a chained Ice Giant as a way to prepare them for dealing with Vulkara. However, chaos ensued when the giant broke free from its chains and threw Thaldor out of the arena, prompting the group to try and subdue the creature themselves. <br><br>
<br>Vulkara is a prior student
<br>She is looking for access to stronger magics
<br><br><br><br><br>
<br>When we start looking for Vulkara or something like that, there are divination spells that I will be able to cast to help find her that only require to know the species or type of creature.

When we arose the next morning, we ate a very interesting breakfast or mechanically manufactured food ranging in degrees of cooked. We then consulted with <a data-href="Gnome Mommy" href="01-dungeons-and-dragons\campaigns\2025-campaign\02-npcs\gnome-mommy.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Gnome Mommy</a> to get the location of the <a data-href="Cave of Knowledge" href="01-dungeons-and-dragons\campaigns\2025-campaign\03-locations\cave-of-knowledge.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Cave of Knowledge</a>. She marked our map and bade us good luck. She also gave us a note to give to the guards so they would know that we were there with her permission<br>Following some very un-eventful travel to the east, we arrived a the cave. After handing the note to the guards and trying to get any information out of them we could, we dove in. We did bet the guards that we would be able to go in and come back out in 10 minutes but luckily they forgot that. <br>After following the main tunnel a decent ways we came upon a hallway that had some suits of armor in it and a door at the far end. Written above the door was a puzzle that involved the door saying numbers and then people saying numbers back. I know that I am a very intelligent wizard but for some reason the puzzle eluded me. Luckily <a data-href="William" href="01-dungeons-and-dragons\campaigns\2025-campaign\02-npcs\william.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">William</a> was with us and as if by divine inspiration was able to tell us the answer, something to do with spelling and numbers, i don't really know. <br>Following this door we entered into a large circular room. On the lefthand wall, there was a large hour glass mounted to the wall on a poll that spun. To the right of the door as we entered was a pool of water and across from us there was another door, closed, with a pile of rocks to the left of it and a chest to the right. <a data-href="Gregor" href="01-dungeons-and-dragons\campaigns\2025-campaign\02-npcs\gregor.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Gregor</a> had not taken a bath in some time so he decided to check out the pool while I went and looked at the hourglass. As I began to inspect it, the door we entered through swung closed and the hourglass flipped itself and began pouring sand. A this point i assumed the room to be a trap and so I fired off a cursory <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="ray-of-frost" data-href="ray-of-frost" href="01-dungeons-and-dragons\cli\spells\ray-of-frost.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Ray of Frost</a> at the chest to ensure that is was not a <a data-href="mimic" href="01-dungeons-and-dragons\cli\bestiary\monstrosity\mimic.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">mimic</a> as I have come to understand they love places like this. I think <a data-href="Alice" href="01-dungeons-and-dragons\campaigns\2025-campaign\01-player-characters\alice.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Alice</a> may have misunderstood my warning shot because as soon as the chest didn't move I knew it was not such a beast but she continued to wail on it the whole time. As the hour glass emptied for the first time, the pile of rocks beside the door formed up into an <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="earth-elemental" data-href="earth-elemental" href="01-dungeons-and-dragons\cli\bestiary\elemental\earth-elemental.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Earth Elemental</a> and began to attack. Knowing as usual that it was up to me to keep my party alive, I cast <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="hold-person" data-href="hold-person" href="01-dungeons-and-dragons\cli\spells\hold-person.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Hold Person</a> on the monstrosity to hold it in place while they beat it up.

After she left the tent I decided to cast <a data-href="clairvoyance" href="01-dungeons-and-dragons\cli\spells\clairvoyance.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">clairvoyance</a> to look into her tent for any potential signs of magic items.<br>The next morning we head out of the town and begin our couple days journey north to <a data-href="Whispering Grove" href="01-dungeons-and-dragons\campaigns\2025-campaign\03-locations\whispering-grove.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Whispering Grove</a>. The first day goes over with some realative ease, we encountered some dead evil bears that tried to mug us but with some use of <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="hypnotic-pattern" data-href="hypnotic-pattern" href="01-dungeons-and-dragons\cli\spells\hypnotic-pattern.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Hypnotic Pattern</a> were able to kill them.

At some point in here we also almost all fell into a hole. Luckily there were some leaves nearby that we were able to use to cleanse ourselves of the poision and move on.<br>
Following the bears we came to a large pond that a tributary flowed through. Upon examining the water <a data-href="Fenna" href="01-dungeons-and-dragons\campaigns\2025-campaign\01-player-characters\fenna.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Fenna</a> got the feeling that something was waiting to attack us.

As I reached about halfway across the lake, 2 <a data-href="bullywug" href="01-dungeons-and-dragons\cli\bestiary\humanoid\bullywug.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">bullywug</a>s jumped out of the water and tried to grab me but I was too high up.<br>We spent the night out in the woods and then finished off our journey the next day.

I see a large lumbering mold/bone creature that seems to be patrolling the area around the main tree. We all prepare to go into the grove to fight this creature.<br>
After some rough planning that involved bad communication and a lot of butt slapping we fight the mold guy and his minions. <br>Upon defeating them, one of the trees surrounding the grove steps forward and slowly transforms into the form of <a data-href="Thaynera" href="01-dungeons-and-dragons\campaigns\2025-campaign\02-npcs\thaynera.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Thaynera</a>.

They later inform Gnome Mommy about a magic item they discovered. On their journey to Whispering Grove, they encounter undead bears, which William defeats. Upon reaching the grove, they prepare for battle against a mold creature and its minions. After defeating them, Thaynera appears and reveals that something is wrong with the current Thorn Mother, urging Fenna to step in and save Grethwyl. She blesses the party to aid them in their mission.^summary<br><br>

<br><br>The winds scraped across the dry arid ground of the Expanse, taking with them the moisture of any who ventured out. A village, small and huddled against the wilderness, lay at the mercy of the elements. It is here that my story begins—not as you know me now, not as seeker of magic, not as big strong man, but as child.<br>My father was a blacksmith, and my mother a tanner. We lived simple lives, forging metal and curing hides to barter for what little we needed. I did not yet know that the thirst of my surroundings was mirrored in myself. lizard can not long for the ocean until it has almost drowned and learned to swim<br>It wasn't till my 10th year that I had to learn to swim<br><br><br>In Expanse, we don't get winter the same as rest of world, we get storms that make&nbsp;<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="app://obsidian.md/brass-dragon" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="\brass-dragon" target="_blank">Brass Dragon</a>&nbsp;wish it had home. That year was worse than any in memory, sandstorms that lasted for days and buried homes, lightning that turned whole areas of desert to glass. Worse still were the&nbsp;things&nbsp;that came with the storm—shadows, unnatural and hungry, stalking the village at night. No one saw them clearly, but people whispered of dark shapes that moved like mist and took whatever they could carry.<br>It was a moonless night, and the village was silent, save for the howling wind. I lay awake, staring at the ceiling of my family’s small home, when e heard it—the sound of something scraping against the walls. I sat up, heart pounding, and saw a shadow move across the room. It was too dark to make out details, but the figure was large, hunched, and inhuman.<br>It lunged.<br>I shouted, throwing himself out of bed as the creature descended on me. I scrambled to the forge and grabbed the last item my father worked on, my axe. I swung wildly, connecting with something solid, but it wasn’t enough. The creature knocked me to the ground, pinning me beneath its weight.<br>In that moment, as I stared into the creature’s empty, shadowed face, something inside him&nbsp;snapped.<br>He screamed—not in fear, but in rage—and reached for anyone, anything, any power, to save myself. The weave answered. Ice erupted from my hands, coating the creature and flinging it across the room. I didn’t stop, the weave would not let me. I rose to my feet, hands outstretched, and let the weave flow from me. Ice spread across the floor, and the air grew cold and calm despite the storms. The creature hissed and shrank back, then melted into the darkness.<br>We did not find my parents, I never did figure out if they were taken, eaten or.... either way, my brethren made their decision. The weave was so much, too much. It flowed through me and I felt connected to it. It was then I made my decision, I would do anything for that connection.<br><br><br>The shadows never returned, but the village was changed. People whispered about what had happened that night, about the boy who had wielded magic against the dark. Some called him blessed, others cursed, for magic of that magnitude was unheard of in the frontier.<br>I didn’t care what the villagers thought. I cared only about one thing: the&nbsp;power&nbsp;I had felt that night. It had been raw, untamed, but it was something I welcomed. And yet, I didn’t understand it. I didn’t know where it had come from or how to control it. That ignorance burned at me. I wanted—needed—to know more.<br>I left the village soon after, setting out to study magic. I wandered from town to town, seeking knowledge wherever I could find it. But magic was rare, and those who possessed it guarded their secrets jealously. I found scraps—old tomes, half-finished spells, and crude enchantments—but it wasn’t enough.<br>My name, however, began to spread. In one town, a merchant dubbed him “Shadewrought” after hearing the story of his first battle with the shadows. The name stuck, a testament to Vladik’s power and the night that had changed his life forever.<br><br><br>Over time, my frustration grew. This world’s magic seems so limited, confined to trinkets and petty charms. I know there is more—I have felt it, we have seen it! My pursuit consumed me. I tested the weave in ways that it had not been before. I tried to emulate magic seen in nature even at the cost of my own health.<br>My early experiments led to the weave itself—the invisible threads that connected all magic. I began to see magic not as a gift or a skill, but as a force of nature, like wind or fire. And like any force, it can be controlled, if one was strong enough to grasp it.<br>This belief drove him forward, creating man you see today: a hardened, gruff, and fiercely intelligent seeker of power. I believe that magic is the key to understanding the world, and I am determined to claim it for myself—no matter the cost.<br><br><br>Vladik’s drive comes from a simple truth: he believes magic is humanity’s only way forward. The world is harsh, cold, and unforgiving. Magic is the only thing powerful enough to shape it, to bend it to humanity’s will. But the people of this world squander magic, treating it as a novelty or a tool for convenience. Vladik sees himself as different. He doesn’t just want to use magic—he wants to&nbsp;master&nbsp;it.<br>To Vladik, magic is not just power; it is freedom. And he will stop at nothing to claim it.<br><br>The tavern was a ramshackle affair, one of many dotting the cold, unforgiving frontier. It wasn’t much, but it had what Vladik needed: a roaring fire, dark corners to sit unnoticed, and plenty of ale. He leaned back in his seat, his fur-lined coat shedding stray snowflakes onto the splintered bench. The evening had been uneventful—just another night watching the ignorant and the drunk babble on about their mundane, magic-lacking lives.<br>Magic was everywhere, yes, but only the shallowest, most surface-level kind. Trinkets to light hearths, charms to fix broken wagon wheels, and the occasional enchanted sword for the village lord's show of power. To Vladik, this wasn’t magic. Magic was something greater—something deeper, untamed, and unending. He had seen glimpses of it in his years of study, in his experiments with the weave. He’d felt it in the way frost crackled at his fingertips or the way the winds shifted with his words. There was&nbsp;more.<br>But no one else seemed to care. People were satisfied with their little baubles, like children playing with toys.&nbsp;Bah,&nbsp;Vladik thought, swirling the last dregs of his drink. His people had called him mad for pursuing it, for pushing magic beyond the boundaries of what everyone said it could do. But to Vladik, there were no boundaries.<br>That’s when he heard it—just a few words, but enough to change everything.<br>
"...just finished my orientation...you wouldn't believe the magic they have there!..."
<br>Vladik’s ear twitched, and his hand froze mid-motion. He strained to hear over the din of the tavern.<br>
"...not sure where he gets them from..."
<br>Who?&nbsp;Vladik wondered.&nbsp;What magic?&nbsp;He gripped the edge of the table, knuckles whitening.<br>
"...can't wait to start at Cinderwind..."
<br>Cinderwind. A name that meant nothing to him, yet it stirred something deep inside. He turned to look at the speaker: a young man, clearly out of his element, talking too loudly to a companion. They were freshly back from somewhere, with eyes wide like children who’d seen a dragon for the first time.<br>Vladik waited, watching them intently, until the conversation drifted to other topics. He left the tavern quietly, but his mind was ablaze. Cinderwind—what kind of place could this be? The way they spoke of it, this was no ordinary school of magic. It sounded like they had access to magic beyond the mundane trinkets of the world.<br>For days, Vladik searched for information. He visited traders, questioned wanderers, even spoke to one or two hedge mages who claimed to know something of the school. It was an institute—an exclusive one, not just for wizards, but for anyone with the drive to master their craft. Cinderwind College, they called it, a place promising to make its students the best of the best. And, more importantly, they claimed to have magic—real magic, the kind Vladik had always hungered for.<br>But not just anyone could join. There was an application process, rigorous and secretive. Vladik was undeterred. Over the next weeks, he worked tirelessly to forge a path to the school.<br>He reached out to contacts—blacksmiths, merchants, and scribes he’d helped over the years. Through charm, coercion, and sheer determination, he pieced together what he needed: an application form, a recommendation from a dubious alchemist, and a sample of his own work.<br>The wait was agonizing. Every day, he woke and checked for a messenger, a sign, anything to confirm his acceptance. He worked harder than ever during this time, perfecting his magic and studying the weave. He needed to be ready for whatever secrets Cinderwind held.<br>Then one morning, it arrived—a letter bearing the seal of Cinderwind College. Vladik’s hands trembled as he broke it open. The letter was brief, congratulating him on his acceptance and providing instructions for the journey to the school.<br>Vladik smirked.&nbsp;“So... they have let wolf into sheep’s den,”&nbsp;he muttered.<br><br>Gallery

 <br><br>The Whispering Grove is the main place of worship of the followers of <a data-href="Thaynera" href="01-dungeons-and-dragons\campaigns\2025-campaign\02-npcs\thaynera.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Thaynera</a>.

The followers look upon the woods with deep reverance and only let the current <a data-href="Thorn Mother" href="Thorn Mother" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Thorn Mother</a> and future prospects enter the woods. The trees in the grove are known to move around and the plant life is exceptionally magical.<br>At the center of the Grove is a large tree with leaves seemingly of gold. Surrounding the central tree is a ring of larger magical trees outlining an open circular clearing under the branched of hte central tree.<br>When we first encountered the grove, it was infected by a odd white fungus/mold that seemed to be affecting the plants, trees, and animals in the area. The infection seems to be getting worse the closer to the center of the grove we got.<br><br>

These seems to be handed out according to the virtues for which they are named: Strength and Wisdom. Solving problems or overcoming challenges by a show of brute force seem to make him allot Strength Tokens while using empathy or knowledge seems to award Wisdom tokens. It is unclear currently if this is a natural phenomenon or if there is some system at the college that is presenting magic in this way to students. ]]></description><link>01-dungeons-and-dragons\campaigns\2025-campaign\04-lore\strength-and-wisdom-tokens.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">01 - Dungeons and Dragons/Campaigns/2025 Campaign/04 - Lore/Strength and Wisdom Tokens.md</guid><pubDate>Mon, 07 Jul 2025 18:23:45 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Timeline]]></title><description><![CDATA[
