He is typically found, usually with his closest friend <a data-href="Gregor" href="02-npcs/gregor.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Gregor</a>, in nature trying to understand the weave and how magic creates the world he interacts with.The winds scraped across the dry arid ground of the Expanse, taking with them the moisture of any who ventured out. A village, small and huddled against the wilderness, lay at the mercy of the elements. It is here that my story begins—not as you know me now, not as seeker of magic, not as big strong man, but as child.My father was a blacksmith, and my mother a tanner. We lived simple lives, forging metal and curing hides to barter for what little we needed. I did not yet know that the thirst of my surroundings was mirrored in myself. lizard can not long for the ocean until it has almost drowned and learned to swimIt wasn't till my 10th year that I had to learn to swim<br>In Expanse, we don't get winter the same as rest of world, we get storms that make&nbsp;<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="app://obsidian.md/brass-dragon" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="brass-dragon/brass-dragon.html" target="_self">Brass Dragon</a>&nbsp;wish it had home. That year was worse than any in memory, sandstorms that lasted for days and buried homes, lightning that turned whole areas of desert to glass. Worse still were the&nbsp;things&nbsp;that came with the storm—shadows, unnatural and hungry, stalking the village at night. No one saw them clearly, but people whispered of dark shapes that moved like mist and took whatever they could carry.It was a moonless night, and the village was silent, save for the howling wind. I lay awake, staring at the ceiling of my family’s small home, when e heard it—the sound of something scraping against the walls. I sat up, heart pounding, and saw a shadow move across the room. It was too dark to make out details, but the figure was large, hunched, and inhuman.It lunged.I shouted, throwing himself out of bed as the creature descended on me. I scrambled to the forge and grabbed the last item my father worked on, my axe. I swung wildly, connecting with something solid, but it wasn’t enough. The creature knocked me to the ground, pinning me beneath its weight.In that moment, as I stared into the creature’s empty, shadowed face, something inside him&nbsp;snapped.He screamed—not in fear, but in rage—and reached for anyone, anything, any power, to save myself. The weave answered. Ice erupted from my hands, coating the creature and flinging it across the room. I didn’t stop, the weave would not let me. I rose to my feet, hands outstretched, and let the weave flow from me. Ice spread across the floor, and the air grew cold and calm despite the storms. The creature hissed and shrank back, then melted into the darkness.We did not find my parents, I never did figure out if they were taken, eaten or.... either way, my brethren made their decision. The weave was so much, too much. It flowed through me and I felt connected to it. It was then I made my decision, I would do anything for that connection.The shadows never returned, but the village was changed. People whispered about what had happened that night, about the boy who had wielded magic against the dark. Some called him blessed, others cursed, for magic of that magnitude was unheard of in the frontier.I didn’t care what the villagers thought. I cared only about one thing: the&nbsp;power&nbsp;I had felt that night. It had been raw, untamed, but it was something I welcomed. And yet, I didn’t understand it. I didn’t know where it had come from or how to control it. That ignorance burned at me. I wanted—needed—to know more.I left the village soon after, setting out to study magic. I wandered from town to town, seeking knowledge wherever I could find it. But magic was rare, and those who possessed it guarded their secrets jealously. I found scraps—old tomes, half-finished spells, and crude enchantments—but it wasn’t enough.My name, however, began to spread. In one town, a merchant dubbed him “Shadewrought” after hearing the story of his first battle with the shadows. The name stuck, a testament to Vladik’s power and the night that had changed his life forever.Over time, my frustration grew. This world’s magic seems so limited, confined to trinkets and petty charms. I know there is more—I have felt it, we have seen it! My pursuit consumed me. I tested the weave in ways that it had not been before. I tried to emulate magic seen in nature even at the cost of my own health.My early experiments led to the weave itself—the invisible threads that connected all magic. I began to see magic not as a gift or a skill, but as a force of nature, like wind or fire. And like any force, it can be controlled, if one was strong enough to grasp it.This belief drove him forward, creating man you see today: a hardened, gruff, and fiercely intelligent seeker of power. I believe that magic is the key to understanding the world, and I am determined to claim it for myself—no matter the cost.Vladik’s drive comes from a simple truth: he believes magic is humanity’s only way forward. The world is harsh, cold, and unforgiving. Magic is the only thing powerful enough to shape it, to bend it to humanity’s will. But the people of this world squander magic, treating it as a novelty or a tool for convenience. Vladik sees himself as different. He doesn’t just want to use magic—he wants to&nbsp;master&nbsp;it.To Vladik, magic is not just power; it is freedom. And he will stop at nothing to claim it.The tavern was a ramshackle affair, one of many dotting the cold, unforgiving frontier. It wasn’t much, but it had what Vladik needed: a roaring fire, dark corners to sit unnoticed, and plenty of ale. He leaned back in his seat, his fur-lined coat shedding stray snowflakes onto the splintered bench. The evening had been uneventful—just another night watching the ignorant and the drunk babble on about their mundane, magic-lacking lives.Magic was everywhere, yes, but only the shallowest, most surface-level kind. Trinkets to light hearths, charms to fix broken wagon wheels, and the occasional enchanted sword for the village lord's show of power. To Vladik, this wasn’t magic. Magic was something greater—something deeper, untamed, and unending. He had seen glimpses of it in his years of study, in his experiments with the weave. He’d felt it in the way frost crackled at his fingertips or the way the winds shifted with his words. There was&nbsp;more.But no one else seemed to care. People were satisfied with their little baubles, like children playing with toys.&nbsp;Bah,&nbsp;Vladik thought, swirling the last dregs of his drink. His people had called him mad for pursuing it, for pushing magic beyond the boundaries of what everyone said it could do. But to Vladik, there were no boundaries.That’s when he heard it—just a few words, but enough to change everything.
"...just finished my orientation...you wouldn't believe the magic they have there!..."
Vladik’s ear twitched, and his hand froze mid-motion. He strained to hear over the din of the tavern.
"...not sure where he gets them from..."
Who?&nbsp;Vladik wondered.&nbsp;What magic?&nbsp;He gripped the edge of the table, knuckles whitening.
"...can't wait to start at Cinderwind..."
Cinderwind. A name that meant nothing to him, yet it stirred something deep inside. He turned to look at the speaker: a young man, clearly out of his element, talking too loudly to a companion. They were freshly back from somewhere, with eyes wide like children who’d seen a dragon for the first time.Vladik waited, watching them intently, until the conversation drifted to other topics. He left the tavern quietly, but his mind was ablaze. Cinderwind—what kind of place could this be? The way they spoke of it, this was no ordinary school of magic. It sounded like they had access to magic beyond the mundane trinkets of the world.For days, Vladik searched for information. He visited traders, questioned wanderers, even spoke to one or two hedge mages who claimed to know something of the school. It was an institute—an exclusive one, not just for wizards, but for anyone with the drive to master their craft. Cinderwind College, they called it, a place promising to make its students the best of the best. And, more importantly, they claimed to have magic—real magic, the kind Vladik had always hungered for.But not just anyone could join. There was an application process, rigorous and secretive. Vladik was undeterred. Over the next weeks, he worked tirelessly to forge a path to the school.He reached out to contacts—blacksmiths, merchants, and scribes he’d helped over the years. Through charm, coercion, and sheer determination, he pieced together what he needed: an application form, a recommendation from a dubious alchemist, and a sample of his own work.The wait was agonizing. Every day, he woke and checked for a messenger, a sign, anything to confirm his acceptance. He worked harder than ever during this time, perfecting his magic and studying the weave. He needed to be ready for whatever secrets Cinderwind held.Then one morning, it arrived—a letter bearing the seal of Cinderwind College. Vladik’s hands trembled as he broke it open. The letter was brief, congratulating him on his acceptance and providing instructions for the journey to the school.Vladik smirked.&nbsp;“So... they have let wolf into sheep’s den,”&nbsp;he muttered.<br>Gallery

They learned about a "First Year Battle Royale" scheduled for midnight at the Coliseum. After splitting into teams, Vladik and Fenna faced off against Alice and Orianna in a free-for-all combat where Alice emerged victorious, claiming a Ring of Protection. The next morning, chaos ensued as the group encountered a Black Pudding on the fourth-year floor, leading to a challenging battle against multiple smaller puddings. After defeating the creatures, they learned from Sabrina that her mysterious box led to the chaos; it contained a letter addressed to Thaldor Coldforce from someone named "V." Vladik decided to investigate further with Orianna while Alice and Fenna approached to inquire about the situation. Character Information

Instead of approaching the topic directly, the 3 ladies decided to approach the topic in a roundabout way and tried to figure out if Thaldor could be trusted. As the group started to leave and regroup, Vladik decided to slip the letter to Thaldor as they left. <br>Upon receiving the letter and reading it Thaldor sat the group down and explained some of what he knew. He told the students that security didn't use to be an issue on campus. There were not attacks or break ins, it was pretty safe. This year has been different and the faculty has started upping security to prevent issues. He also gave us a lot of information about <a data-href="Vulkara" href="02-npcs/vulkara.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Vulkara</a>, she was a student at Cinderwind almost 100 years ago. She was the first Eldritch Knight that Thaldor ever met and had a large appetite for magic. Eventually she became frustrated at the slow pace that the college was able to handout advancements and process. After filling us in, he told us that he would meet us later in the colosseum to show us something.We killed some time after this meeting and then proceeded to the colosseum. As we arrived, we see, chained down in the center of the arena, a large Ice Giant. Thaldor seems to be drugged out and fretting around the giant. He goes on to explain that he wanted to give us some up close interaction with a Frost Giant so we would know what we are dealing with with Vulkara. Suddenly the giant broke one of his chains and threw Thaldor out of the arena, we then started to try and subdue the giant ourselves.Summary:: In Session 5, the group approached Thaldor Coldforce to gather information about a mysterious letter they had found. Instead of directly addressing the letter, they sought to ascertain Thaldor's trustworthiness, while Vladik discreetly slipped the letter to him as they left. Thaldor shared insights about recent security concerns on campus and recounted the story of Vulkara, a former student and the first Eldritch Knight, who became frustrated with the college's slow pace in magic advancements. He later invited the group to the colosseum for an up-close encounter with a chained Ice Giant as a way to prepare them for dealing with Vulkara. However, chaos ensued when the giant broke free from its chains and threw Thaldor out of the arena, prompting the group to try and subdue the creature themselves. Vulkara is a prior student
She is looking for access to stronger magics When we start looking for Vulkara or something like that, there are divination spells that I will be able to cast to help find her that only require to know the species or type of creature.

<a data-href="Thaynera" href="02-npcs/thaynera.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Thaynera</a> Summary:: In this session, the group journeyed to the village of Grethwyl, discovering it in a state of decay and realizing they needed to act quickly. After navigating through a maze of plant walls, they confronted and ultimately defeated a dragon named Oakshade, who had taken on the role of the Thorn Mother by killing the real one. Following Oakshade's defeat, Fenna chose not to assume the position of Thorn Mother herself, opting for a council-based leadership instead. The session concluded with celebrations in the village, though one party member felt frustrated by their lack of recognition and support from a deity figure. <br> We awoke the next morning in a new <a data-href="Grethwyl" href="03-locations/grethwyl.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Grethwyl</a>, the people immediately trying to reclaim their town and lives much like the forest around them trying to reclaim it's own loss. Celebration still filled the air if in a more muted tone. There was no disdain for the work that these people had to undertake, just a pleasure at it being work they chose. <br> Once we had all risen from a well deserved night, I don't think <a data-href="Fenna" href="01-player-characters/fenna.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Fenna</a> realizes how much work she does for all of us and finds it hard to relax and was of course the first one up. <a data-href="Thaynera" href="02-npcs/thaynera.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Thaynera</a> greeted us as we arose and let us know she would hasten the next part of our journey once we were prepared to leave. <a data-href="Fenna" href="01-player-characters/fenna.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Fenna</a> said her fairwells to her family and the town she was once destined to lead. (I can't say that I understand relenting a position like that. While a different kind of power, leadership brings with it it's own strengths. I do suppose it bring its own restrictions as well though.)

I do not know what type of spell this was but I imagine the weaving is similar to the portals <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Thaldor Coldforce" data-href="Thaldor Coldforce" href="02-npcs/thaldor-coldforce.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Thaldor</a> has set up, I will have to ask him if he has seen it before.<br>We had brief but not brief enough interaction with <a data-href="ReRe" href="02-npcs/rere.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">ReRe</a> where, for reasons I can't understand, <a data-href="Fenna" href="01-player-characters/fenna.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Fenna</a> tried to get her to buy jerky?

Jumping through the portal back to <a data-href="Cinderwind College" href="03-locations/cinderwind-college.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Cinderwind College</a> was uneventful if not uninteresting. We did have to wait a good 10 minutes for <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Thaldor Coldforce" data-href="Thaldor Coldforce" href="02-npcs/thaldor-coldforce.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Thaldor</a> to finally come let us out. He arrived with some urgency, beckoned us to follow him to the cafeteria, and then ran away. Assumedly he ran the whole way because he was not in sight once we exited the offices. <br>When we reached the Cafeteria we decided to make a show of entering as we had just returned from killing a dragon, no small feat. We slammed the doors open and made the wind whip around us as well as some lights shine from behind. The entrance was grand if I do say so myself, however it was not the time. The cafeteria had been comletely changed, hanging from the ceiling were banners and decorations, all the tables had been moved to the walls and set up in little stations with some magic gadgets on them. A podium was set up at the far end of the hall where <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Thaldor Coldforce" data-href="Thaldor Coldforce" href="02-npcs/thaldor-coldforce.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Thaldor</a> was apparently giving a speech. It took me a second to catch up but apparently this was the opening ceremony for some annual competition between us and the other magic school <a data-href="Seiluna Institute" href="03-locations/seiluna-institute.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Seiluna Institute</a>. <br><a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Thaldor Coldforce" data-href="Thaldor Coldforce" href="02-npcs/thaldor-coldforce.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Thaldor</a> welcomed the other students and headmaster and explained the games to us. Using some new illusion magic technology, 3 teams of 4 students from each school would be competing in an illusory competition. I believe this was to make the event safer as apparently in past years.... events ocurred. I also believe though, knowing that there were no consequenses ultimately made the events more dangerous but that is not a complaint. The final team standing would be awarded 5,000gp as well as bragging rights for the rest of the year. It did seem like we kicked out a group of 3rd years that were supposed to compete but I will let them sort that with <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Thaldor Coldforce" data-href="Thaldor Coldforce" href="02-npcs/thaldor-coldforce.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Thaldor</a>. With that explained, all teams were sent to one of the tables against the walls and handed a fancy circlet to put on. <br>This magic was truly stunning. Upon putting the circlet on my head all of my senses seemed to be captured and put under the control of this device. I still felt like me and looked like me but I was no longer in the cafeteria. Around me was a blank room with nothing to distinguish it, my fellows were there with me and seemed to be adjusting to this magic as well. Locked to the corners of my vision were different pieces of information, apparently the method of tracking information within the game. It was a very creative application of illusion magic that I will have to see if I can replicate. At the top of my vision a large box appeared, within it were the words "Enter the door" and an empty box. At the same time, on the wall across from us a door appeared. We shared a look between us, confirming that everyone saw this, and then walked up and opened the door. The box was filled with a check mark and we walked into the next room. Assumedly this was just to get us used to the device and how it worked and not actually a challenge (although there is rumor that one of the <a data-href="Seiluna Institute" href="03-locations/seiluna-institute.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Seiluna Institute</a> teams didn't actually make it this far.) On the other side of the door was a long hallway decorated in a similar fashion with torches lining the walls every 25 feet or so. The only noticable difference was the floor, aside from directly where we entered and the far end of the hall, the entire floor was covered in mud. As we all stepped into the room the door behind us didn't close, it disappeared completely. As the door vanished, the quest description changed as well; "Reach the other end.". We all assumed this would be a fairly simple task, and in hindsight we should have found this suspicious but I believe we still just assumed it was trying to acclimate us to the magic. <br>I took the first steps into the mud with <a data-href="Orianna" href="01-player-characters/orianna.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Orianna</a> trudging close behind me. I made it about 15' or so before <a data-href="Alice" href="01-player-characters/alice.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Alice</a> and <a data-href="Fenna" href="01-player-characters/fenna.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Fenna</a> followed, walking about 15' behind and to the side of us. As I went to take my next step all of the torched on the walls fell from their sconces as one landing in the mud. Now, I imagine the mud was some sort of magic concoction, seeing that the mud immediately ignited and started spreading. Suddenly this challenge made way more sense. Realizing that we needed to get through this and trying to prevent our way out from being closed off I sent a blast of cold at one of the fires as soon as it caught at the end of the hall to prevent it spreading. I took a couple more steps and the situation became even more dire. I placed my foot on the ground and heard a loud metallic click followed by an odd pain in my leg. Looking down I found my leg caught between the jaws of a large bear trap. The game must have been doing something to my pain senses as I felt it and knew it had happened but it was not near the pain it should have been. In order to escape the trap as well as progress further towards our goal I used the new <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="misty-step" data-href="misty-step" href="01-dungeons-and-dragons/cli/spells/misty-step.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Misty Step</a> spell that I discovered. <br>Looking back I should have more effectively communicated my plans to the team as I believe they thought I was trying to leave them behind. I thought that maybe there would be a switch or method of extinguishing the flames at the far end so I figured that if I could get there quickly I would be able to save them from the flames. This was not the case. While not too dangerous in reality this did take some time to get through. <a data-href="Fenna" href="01-player-characters/fenna.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Fenna</a> and <a data-href="Alice" href="01-player-characters/alice.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Alice</a> stuck together through most of it, at one point using one of <a data-href="Alice" href="01-player-characters/alice.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Alice</a>'s hand axes and rope to make a type of rope swing to avoid the flaming mud. <a data-href="Orianna" href="01-player-characters/orianna.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Orianna</a> took a different approach and decided that summoning a boar from her <a data-href="bag-of-tricks" href="01-dungeons-and-dragons/cli/items/bag-of-tricks.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">bag-of-tricks</a> was a good idea. I don't know that I will ever understand that woman but I do applaud her creativity, now to find a way to channel it. <br>We made it through, the rest of it was the same story again. We waded through the mud, got caught in a number of traps, and I think <a data-href="Alice" href="01-player-characters/alice.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Alice</a> and <a data-href="Fenna" href="01-player-characters/fenna.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Fenna</a> both got a bit more singed than they would have liked but we made it to the end. 4 teams made it through this challenge, and I don't envy the ones that didn't for multiple reasons, What a way to go, even in an illusion. Summary:: The group awoke in the town of Grethwyl, where they witnessed the townspeople beginning to reclaim their lives after recent events. After saying their farewells, they were transported back to ReRe's Cave and then to Cinderwind College, where they discovered an annual competition with Seiluna Institute was about to begin. Using new illusion magic, teams were challenged to navigate through a series of rooms, starting with a hallway covered in magical mud that ignited when touched. The team faced various traps and obstacles but ultimately managed to reach the end of the challenge, alongside three other teams. Fire is definitely a big issue that I need to find a solution for. I know there are spells that will put out fire in an area, I just need to manage to learn one of them. ]]></description><link>00-session-notes/session-10.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">01 - Dungeons and Dragons/Campaigns/2025 Campaign/00 - Session Notes/Session 10.md</guid><pubDate>Wed, 23 Jul 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="." length="0" type="false"/><content:encoded>&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="."&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[session 10]]></title><description><![CDATA[<img src="00-session-notes/attachments/session-10.png" target="_self">]]></description><link>00-session-notes/attachments/session-10.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">01 - Dungeons and Dragons/Campaigns/2025 Campaign/00 - Session Notes/attachments/session 10.png</guid><pubDate>Thu, 07 Aug 2025 15:59:27 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="." length="0" type="false"/><content:encoded>&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="."&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Cinderwind College]]></title><description><![CDATA[Dataview: No results to show for table query.]]></description><link>03-locations/cinderwind-college.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">01 - Dungeons and Dragons/Campaigns/2025 Campaign/03 - Locations/Cinderwind College.md</guid><pubDate>Thu, 07 Aug 2025 15:32:06 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[cinderwind]]></title><description><![CDATA[<img src="03-locations/attachments/cinderwind.jpg" target="_self">]]></description><link>03-locations/attachments/cinderwind.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">01 - Dungeons and Dragons/Campaigns/2025 Campaign/03 - Locations/Attachments/cinderwind.jpg</guid><pubDate>Thu, 07 Aug 2025 15:29:07 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="." length="0" type="false"/><content:encoded>&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="."&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Truvidale]]></title><description><![CDATA[Quick Calculator Map Height in Pixels: Map Width in Pixels: lat: 768

Instead of directly addressing the letter, they sought to ascertain Thaldor's trustworthiness, while Vladik discreetly slipped the letter to him as they left. Thaldor shared insights about recent security concerns on campus and recounted the story of Vulkara, a former student and the first Eldritch Knight, who became frustrated with the college's slow pace in magic advancements. He later invited the group to the colosseum for an up-close encounter with a chained Ice Giant as a way to prepare them for dealing with Vulkara. However, chaos ensued when the giant broke free from its chains and threw Thaldor out of the arena, prompting the group to try and subdue the creature themselves.

<a data-href="Thad" href=".html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Thad</a> Summary:: After exiting the Cave of Knowledge and surprising the guards with a summoned badger, the group returns to Tinkford, where they fabricate a story about the badger being a magical creature. They later inform Gnome Mommy about a magic item they discovered. On their journey to Whispering Grove, they encounter undead bears, which William defeats. Upon reaching the grove, they prepare for battle against a mold creature and its minions. After defeating them, Thaynera appears and reveals that something is wrong with the current Thorn Mother, urging Fenna to step in and save Grethwyl. She blesses the party to aid them in their mission. <br>We rose early the next morning to make the journey north to <a data-href="Grethwyl" href="03-locations/grethwyl.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Grethwyl</a>. This leg of the journey was far easier than the one to get here since <a data-href="Fenna" href="01-player-characters/fenna.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Fenna</a> and <a data-href="William" href="02-npcs/william.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">William</a> are familiar with this region of the woods. Over the course of our travels the last couple days I have come to realize I am very luck to have survived my first trip into these woods. I knew <a data-href="Jakunta" href="03-locations/jakunta.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Jakunta</a> to be a formidable foe but did not realize quite how dangerous these woods can be. <br>The trip was uneventful until we started nearing our destination. I had previously asked <a data-href="Fenna" href="01-player-characters/fenna.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Fenna</a> and <a data-href="William" href="02-npcs/william.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">William</a> to let me know when we were approaching a mile or so out from town as I would then be able to scope out the approaching trials for us. Fortunately or unfortunately I should not have worried about asking for as we neared that marker the forest changed drastically. Ahead of us we saw a solid wall of vines and forest growth roughly 20 feet tall with a green haze/fog right at the top. We paused for a moment for me to cast <a data-href="clairvoyance" href="01-dungeons-and-dragons/cli/spells/clairvoyance.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">clairvoyance</a> and figure out what awaited us in the village. Using the descriptions give to me by <a data-href="Fenna" href="01-player-characters/fenna.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Fenna</a> and <a data-href="William" href="02-npcs/william.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">William</a>, I was easily able to see into their town. Around myself I saw the village as normal, except for no animals around. However, as I maintained the spell, the images started to flicker back and forth between what was described to me and what can only be called a disaster. The house were nearly destroyed, all the plant were dead, there were no animals in sight. Lined up at a pyre in the center of town seemed to be all of the townsfolk and they were carrying seemingly random objects. Ending the spell I communicated both visions of the town without much certainty as to what we would find ahead but certain that we should hurry. <br>Realizing we needed to get there quickly I recommended we send <a data-href="Gregor" href="02-npcs/gregor.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Gregor</a> over the wall to see if he could see anything. I began to just send him on his way when <a data-href="Orianna" href="01-player-characters/orianna.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Orianna</a> recommended we tie him to her arrow and shoot him onto the wall. With much reluctance and a promise of treats I was able to convince him to do so. <a data-href="Orianna" href="01-player-characters/orianna.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Orianna</a> took aim, loosed, and hit exactly at the rim of the wall. <a data-href="Gregor" href="02-npcs/gregor.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Gregor</a> then reached up to pull himself over the lip of the wall, but when his hand touched the fog he broke our bond and went back to the fae wild. Assumedly the fog harmed him and rather than die, he shifted planes. What a bother, he was already upset at being shot through the air and now I have to deal with this. <br>Seeing as we couldn't go over the wall and we didn't know what was beyond it, I did what I thought was rational; I used my new fancy cross bow to shoot a hole in it. It was after all made up of plants. <a data-href="Fenna" href="01-player-characters/fenna.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Fenna</a> quickly tried to yell at me but I reminded her that she had said burning things and swearing were both allowed now that we were on our way to eliminate the imposter. Through the hole in the wall we saw yet another wall of plants. I thought maybe there was a platform over it and this was an interior passage for a fortification so I shot through the next wall as well. Lo and behold, another wall! We all looked at it for a couple seconds before <a data-href="Alice" href="01-player-characters/alice.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Alice</a> and I both had the same revelation, we were looking at the interior walls of a maze! It was in this moment that I grew a larger appreciation for my muscle bound companion despite her young years and lacking intellect, maybe I should try to help her more. Regardless, knowing that there was a maze of unknown size ahead of us, I recommended we continue to blast our way through as it had worked thus far. <br>The excursion through the maze was relatively uneventful. We encountered a couple wolves that <a data-href="Alice" href="01-player-characters/alice.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Alice</a> and <a data-href="William" href="02-npcs/william.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">William</a> dispatched with ease, followed by some other things that I frankly don't remember. One that did impress me though was, as I shot through like the 20th wall, a wave of poisonous gas like what killed <a data-href="Gregor" href="02-npcs/gregor.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Gregor</a>, came spilling out. In a moment of pure instinct, <a data-href="Fenna" href="01-player-characters/fenna.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Fenna</a> conjured and absolutely amazing <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="wind-wall" data-href="wind-wall" href="01-dungeons-and-dragons/cli/spells/wind-wall.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Wind Wall</a> and kept the gas contained. It seemed like she cast the spell before she even knew it herself. I must have more respect for my allies as they are growing as much as I am through all of this. <br>Some time later (it may have been faster to do the maze but we will never know I guess) I fired through the last wall and <a data-href="Grethwyl" href="03-locations/grethwyl.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Grethwyl</a> lay before us. The village matched up with the decayed/destroyed images that I was seeing earlier, and as I reflect I can only assume that maybe that was the result of what I was looking for and the reality of the location being so different, I will have to study this. Something I missed in my earlier survey was a large throne at the center of town and sitting upon it was <a data-href="Oakshade" href=".html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Oakshade</a>. In retrospect, blasting through the walls may not have been the most subtle of ways of entering the town but it definitely got the job done. The entire town turned to look at us and witness as <a data-href="Fenna" href="01-player-characters/fenna.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Fenna</a> absolutely bombed being subtle. <a data-href="Oakshade" href=".html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Oakshade</a> did some rambling and monologueing about "why I should rule" and "why you suck" among other things but ultimately common ground could not be found. <br>The fight started with <a data-href="Orianna" href="01-player-characters/orianna.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Orianna</a> throwing a tiger?? I don't fully understand how her mind works ever but I do envy her attitude. I tried to take some of <a data-href="Oakshade" href=".html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Oakshade</a>'s companions out of the fight with a <a data-href="slow" href="01-dungeons-and-dragons/cli/spells/slow.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">slow</a> spell but it only got 2 of them. Rather quickly we took out her 4 body guards (I found out their names to be <a data-href="Brad" href="02-npcs/brad.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Brad</a>, <a data-href="Chad" href=".html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Chad</a>, <a data-href="Gallad" href=".html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Gallad</a>, and <a data-href="Thad" href=".html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Thad</a>; apparenlty <a data-href="Fenna" href="01-player-characters/fenna.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Fenna</a> dated all of them, she is not who I thought) and were left with <a data-href="Oakshade" href=".html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Oakshade</a> herself. Just as it looked like we might finish the job her body began to convulse and writhe. Wings began to push through and rip her back as all parts of her started to grow, swell, and darken. Turns out she's a dragon (or should I say was ;)). She ranted on again about "youngest sibling of 13" and "no respect" and "unable to make a lair" all kinds of garbage. Essentially, she wasn't strong enough to make her own way in the world so she figured, why not take someone elses work and put her claws on it. She found the actuall Thorn Mother <a data-href="Oakshade" href=".html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Oakshade</a> in the woods one day and took her captive, learning enough about her to be able to play the part well. She then killed her and came back to the village. Unfortunately for our friend <a data-href="Fenna" href="01-player-characters/fenna.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Fenna</a> this was enough time for her to go through the ritual and be picked as the replacement Thorn Mother, creating all the confusion. <br>Well, we killed her. It wasn't easy, well maybe for me, but it was a good fight. At one point <a data-href="Orianna" href="01-player-characters/orianna.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Orianna</a> tried to convince <a data-href="get-dragon-name" href=".html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">get-dragon-name</a> to become president of the <a data-href="Hammerhead Isles" href=".html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Hammerhead Isles</a>, again, what is going on in her brain. That didn't work though so we just offed her. All in a days work for us honestly. I am a bit disappointed, most of my friends were unconsious at the end of the fight and I had finally come up with a stellar plan to save the day when the freaking towns people shot her out of the sky. Bit of a let down if i'm honest but we will see if I have another chance to do it. <br>Everything after the fight is a bit of a blur honestly. I know the towns people celebrated the return of <a data-href="Fenna" href="01-player-characters/fenna.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Fenna</a> after realizing that she was the rightful Thorn Mother. <a data-href="Thaynera" href="02-npcs/thaynera.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Thaynera</a> came out of the woods at some point and let everyone know what had happened alongside <a data-href="Fenna" href="01-player-characters/fenna.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Fenna</a>. <a data-href="Fenna" href="01-player-characters/fenna.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Fenna</a> also decided that she no longer wanted to be the Thorn Mother. I don't know if this is because she decided that travel suits her or that she doesn't like the idea of leading or that ultimately all leadership leads to corruption regardless of how pure your motives may be. No matter the reason, her and the Thorn Mother decided that the people would be better led by a group of people so that no one voice carried to much sway in what happened in the town. I do think this was a good idea. <br>Celebration ensued and you might guess. I did find a time to go talk with <a data-href="Thaynera" href="02-npcs/thaynera.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Thaynera</a>. I explained to her what I have observed, that <a data-href="Fenna" href="01-player-characters/fenna.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Fenna</a> carries a heavy burden in our group. That of keeping us alive. I think she enjoys doing it but I know that being the only one to do so is a lot. I asked <a data-href="Thaynera" href="02-npcs/thaynera.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Thaynera</a> if she might be able to teach me or to help lighten the burden on <a data-href="Fenna" href="01-player-characters/fenna.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Fenna</a> in some way. In response, she said that "Healing is a magic I can not give to you but one that you must find yourself" or some bull crap like that. Honestly, gods still suck. Here I am, being very genuine and trying to help her follower, and all I get is some sage mumbo jumbo about "find yourself young one". I obviously did not tell her any of this but instead thanked her for her help and went to enjoy the night.<br>I did not resummon <a data-href="Gregor" href="02-npcs/gregor.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Gregor</a>. I can't deal with the drama right now.Summary:: In this session, the group journeyed to the village of Grethwyl, discovering it in a state of decay and realizing they needed to act quickly. After navigating through a maze of plant walls, they confronted and ultimately defeated a dragon named Oakshade, who had taken on the role of the Thorn Mother by killing the real one. Following Oakshade's defeat, Fenna chose not to assume the position of Thorn Mother herself, opting for a council-based leadership instead. The session concluded with celebrations in the village, though one party member felt frustrated by their lack of recognition and support from a deity figure. <br>Thorn Mother <a data-href="Oakshade" href=".html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Oakshade</a> was not evil but had been murdered and replaced by <a data-href="get-dragon-name" href=".html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">get-dragon-name</a>

Upon reaching <a data-href="Tinkford" href="03-locations/tinkford.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Tinkford</a>, we decide that these people can't know the truth apparently so we instead tell them that there was a magical <a data-href="badger" href="01-dungeons-and-dragons/cli/bestiary/beast/badger.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">badger</a> that was being protected in the cave and for some reason <a data-href="Fenna" href="01-player-characters/fenna.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Fenna</a>, despite being the nicest of us, decides to try and convince the town that this badger is some magical being that they need to take care of and worship. After this debacle, we do get <a data-href="Gnome Mommy" href="02-npcs/gnome-mommy.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Gnome Mommy</a> alone in our tent and let her know about the magic item that we found in the center room and what it did for us. After she left the tent I decided to cast <a data-href="clairvoyance" href="01-dungeons-and-dragons/cli/spells/clairvoyance.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">clairvoyance</a> to look into her tent for any potential signs of magic items.<br>The next morning we head out of the town and begin our couple days journey north to <a data-href="Whispering Grove" href="03-locations/whispering-grove.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Whispering Grove</a>. The first day goes over with some realative ease, we encountered some dead evil bears that tried to mug us but with some use of <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="hypnotic-pattern" data-href="hypnotic-pattern" href="01-dungeons-and-dragons/cli/spells/hypnotic-pattern.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Hypnotic Pattern</a> were able to kill them. In a surprise turn of events, <a data-href="William" href="02-npcs/william.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">William</a> was able to kill off all the bears.
At some point in here we also almost all fell into a hole. Luckily there were some leaves nearby that we were able to use to cleanse ourselves of the poision and move on.<br>
Following the bears we came to a large pond that a tributary flowed through. Upon examining the water <a data-href="Fenna" href="01-player-characters/fenna.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Fenna</a> got the feeling that something was waiting to attack us. Everyone piled into the <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="bag-of-holding" data-href="bag-of-holding" href="01-dungeons-and-dragons/cli/items/bag-of-holding.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Bag of Holding</a> and I used <a data-href="levitate" href="01-dungeons-and-dragons/cli/spells/levitate.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">levitate</a> to fly myself and the bag up and over the lake.

As we go to bed outside the <a data-href="Whispering Grove" href="03-locations/whispering-grove.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Whispering Grove</a> I cast <a data-href="clairvoyance" href="01-dungeons-and-dragons/cli/spells/clairvoyance.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">clairvoyance</a> again to get a view of what awaits us in the center of this grove. I see a large lumbering mold/bone creature that seems to be patrolling the area around the main tree. We all prepare to go into the grove to fight this creature.
After some rough planning that involved bad communication and a lot of butt slapping we fight the mold guy and his minions. <br>Upon defeating them, one of the trees surrounding the grove steps forward and slowly transforms into the form of <a data-href="Thaynera" href="02-npcs/thaynera.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Thaynera</a>. She then explains to us that she is using the last of her strength to form this image and some minor protection of the area. Something is wrong with the current Thorn Mother and that <a data-href="Fenna" href="01-player-characters/fenna.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Fenna</a> needs to step in and save <a data-href="Grethwyl" href="03-locations/grethwyl.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Grethwyl</a>. <a data-href="Thaynera" href="02-npcs/thaynera.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Thaynera</a> then gives each of us a blessing in order to help us with our fight against the Thorn Mother.Summary:: After exiting the Cave of Knowledge and surprising the guards with a summoned badger, the group returns to Tinkford, where they fabricate a story about the badger being a magical creature. They later inform Gnome Mommy about a magic item they discovered. On their journey to Whispering Grove, they encounter undead bears, which William defeats. Upon reaching the grove, they prepare for battle against a mold creature and its minions. After defeating them, Thaynera appears and reveals that something is wrong with the current Thorn Mother, urging Fenna to step in and save Grethwyl.

When we arose the next morning, we ate a very interesting breakfast or mechanically manufactured food ranging in degrees of cooked. We then consulted with <a data-href="Gnome Mommy" href="02-npcs/gnome-mommy.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Gnome Mommy</a> to get the location of the <a data-href="Cave of Knowledge" href="03-locations/cave-of-knowledge.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Cave of Knowledge</a>. She marked our map and bade us good luck. She also gave us a note to give to the guards so they would know that we were there with her permissionFollowing some very un-eventful travel to the east, we arrived a the cave. After handing the note to the guards and trying to get any information out of them we could, we dove in. We did bet the guards that we would be able to go in and come back out in 10 minutes but luckily they forgot that. <br>After following the main tunnel a decent ways we came upon a hallway that had some suits of armor in it and a door at the far end. Written above the door was a puzzle that involved the door saying numbers and then people saying numbers back. I know that I am a very intelligent wizard but for some reason the puzzle eluded me. Luckily <a data-href="William" href="02-npcs/william.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">William</a> was with us and as if by divine inspiration was able to tell us the answer, something to do with spelling and numbers, i don't really know. <br>Following this door we entered into a large circular room. On the lefthand wall, there was a large hour glass mounted to the wall on a poll that spun. To the right of the door as we entered was a pool of water and across from us there was another door, closed, with a pile of rocks to the left of it and a chest to the right. <a data-href="Gregor" href="02-npcs/gregor.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Gregor</a> had not taken a bath in some time so he decided to check out the pool while I went and looked at the hourglass. As I began to inspect it, the door we entered through swung closed and the hourglass flipped itself and began pouring sand. A this point i assumed the room to be a trap and so I fired off a cursory <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="ray-of-frost" data-href="ray-of-frost" href="01-dungeons-and-dragons/cli/spells/ray-of-frost.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Ray of Frost</a> at the chest to ensure that is was not a <a data-href="mimic" href="01-dungeons-and-dragons/cli/bestiary/monstrosity/mimic.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">mimic</a> as I have come to understand they love places like this. I think <a data-href="Alice" href="01-player-characters/alice.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Alice</a> may have misunderstood my warning shot because as soon as the chest didn't move I knew it was not such a beast but she continued to wail on it the whole time. As the hour glass emptied for the first time, the pile of rocks beside the door formed up into an <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="earth-elemental" data-href="earth-elemental" href="01-dungeons-and-dragons/cli/bestiary/elemental/earth-elemental.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Earth Elemental</a> and began to attack. Knowing as usual that it was up to me to keep my party alive, I cast <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="hold-person" data-href="hold-person" href="01-dungeons-and-dragons/cli/spells/hold-person.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Hold Person</a> on the monstrosity to hold it in place while they beat it up. Through this the hourglass continued to drain and as it emptied it flipped itself over and started again. About that time I believe <a data-href="Alice" href="01-player-characters/alice.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Alice</a> took the final swing on the rocks, which was fortunate, because the puddle <a data-href="Gregor" href="02-npcs/gregor.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Gregor</a> had been bathing in, turned into a <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="water-elemental" data-href="water-elemental" href="01-dungeons-and-dragons/cli/bestiary/elemental/water-elemental.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Water Elemental</a> and decided to come after me for some reason. Using another well put <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="hold-person" data-href="hold-person" href="01-dungeons-and-dragons/cli/spells/hold-person.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Hold Person</a> I grabbed this monster as well and prevented it from even getting an attack off on us. I then used my incredible strength to try and hold the hour glass in place but did drop it for a second as we fought the elementa, which was lucky because the third emptying opened the door on our way out. Walking up to the door we finally got to inspect <a data-href="Alice" href="01-player-characters/alice.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Alice</a>'s handiwork and the chest and found some, thankfully unbroken, healing potions. ]]></description><link>00-session-notes/session-7.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">01 - Dungeons and Dragons/Campaigns/2025 Campaign/00 - Session Notes/Session 7.md</guid><pubDate>Mon, 28 Jul 2025 20:48:38 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="." length="0" type="false"/><content:encoded>&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="."&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Session 4]]></title><description><![CDATA[Summary:: Vladik and Orianna successfully sneak into the faculty offices and snoop around.

As we all awoke and came out into the common area we saw a note hung on the notice board that said "Students are to meet in the dinning hall at 9:30am for message from faculty.".

They welcome in the group and explain the rules of what is going to happen. There will be a selection of magical items available for everyone to choose from and then it is free-for-all combat. The last person standing gets to take an item of their choosing but the rest stay. After quickly picking out some items, combat begins.

The bloodied and beaten first years all returned to the dorms and went to sleep. <br>All the first years are awoken first thing in the morning by yelling and screaming from a higher floor. As they take off up the stairs they pass <a data-href="Sabrina" href=".html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Sabrina</a>, <a data-href="Katie" href="02-npcs/katie.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Katie</a>, and <a data-href="Katy" href=".html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Katy</a> all coming down. Arriving on the 4th year floor everyone see a large <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="black-pudding" data-href="black-pudding" href="01-dungeons-and-dragons/cli/bestiary/ooze/black-pudding.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Black Pudding</a> in the middle of the room. As it falls from the ceiling and hits the floor the students decide to engage with it. They quickly learn to not pierce it or hit it with lightning as these both seem to make it split instead of hurting it. The group now has to deal with 4 smaller puddings that are causing damage to not only them, but their gear as well. Then as the combat seems to be slowing, a second pudding appears from down the hall and begins attacking <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Vladik Shadewrought" data-href="Vladik Shadewrought" href="01-player-characters/vladik-shadewrought.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Vladik</a>. <br>After dealing with all the monsters; <a data-href="Trevalia" href="02-npcs/trevalia.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Trevalia</a>, <a data-href="Sabrina" href=".html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Sabrina</a>, <a data-href="Katie" href="02-npcs/katie.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Katie</a>, and <a data-href="Katy" href=".html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Katy</a> all come up the stairs. Trevalia looks disturbed at the situation, makes sure the students are okay, and then takes the damaged gear to be repaired. Vladik tries to walk down the hallway to see where the puddings came from but is stopped by <a data-href="Sabrina" href=".html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Sabrina</a> telling him not to go into her room. After a brief interaction where <a data-href="Orianna" href="01-player-characters/orianna.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Orianna</a> was causing problems and Vladik put her to sleep, Sabrina goes into her room and returns with a box and a letter. She explains that the box was given to her by a halfling outside of campus with instructions to deliver to <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Thaldor Coldforce" data-href="Thaldor Coldforce" href="02-npcs/thaldor-coldforce.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Thaldor</a>. Sabrina decided to take a peak in the box and that is when the puddings jumped out. She hands both the box and letter to Vladik who picks up the sleeping <a data-href="Orianna" href="01-player-characters/orianna.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Orianna</a> and decides to go investigate the letter. <br>Taking the letter to his room, <a data-href="Vladik" href=".html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Vladik</a> first explains to <a data-href="Orianna" href="01-player-characters/orianna.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Orianna</a> why he put her to sleep and shows her what having a conversation got them; evidence.

The letter is addressed to <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Thaldor Coldforce" data-href="Thaldor Coldforce" href="02-npcs/thaldor-coldforce.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Thaldor</a> and is signed "V" whom Vladik assumes to be <a data-href="Vulkara" href="02-npcs/vulkara.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Vulkara</a>. <a data-href="Alice" href="01-player-characters/alice.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Alice</a> and <a data-href="Fenna" href="01-player-characters/fenna.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Fenna</a> then approach Vladik's room and it sounds like they may have been trying to spy but Vladik decides to let them in and explain what he has. Session EndsSummary:: The session began with the first-year students reflecting on the previous day's events involving Sylva, a goblin in disguise, and attending a faculty meeting where campus security was heightened. They learned about a "First Year Battle Royale" scheduled for midnight at the Coliseum. After splitting into teams, Vladik and Fenna faced off against Alice and Orianna in a free-for-all combat where Alice emerged victorious, claiming a Ring of Protection. The next morning, chaos ensued as the group encountered a Black Pudding on the fourth-year floor, leading to a challenging battle against multiple smaller puddings. After defeating the creatures, they learned from Sabrina that her mysterious box led to the chaos; it contained a letter addressed to Thaldor Coldforce from someone named "V." Vladik decided to investigate further with Orianna while Alice and Fenna approached to inquire about the situation. ]]></description><link>00-session-notes/session-4.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">01 - Dungeons and Dragons/Campaigns/2025 Campaign/00 - Session Notes/Session 4.md</guid><pubDate>Mon, 28 Jul 2025 20:47:44 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Session 3]]></title><description><![CDATA[Character Information

This made <a data-href="Arith" href="02-npcs/arith.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Arith</a> suspicious and <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Vladik Shadewrought" data-href="Vladik Shadewrought" href="01-player-characters/vladik-shadewrought.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Vladik</a>, not wanting this plan to fail, decided to cast <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="suggestion" data-href="suggestion" href="01-dungeons-and-dragons/cli/spells/suggestion.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Suggestion</a> on <a data-href="Arith" href="02-npcs/arith.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Arith</a>, telling him to leave them alone and take a walk around the campus.<br>
Having narrowly avoided disaster, the pair continue on their way. After failing to remember that <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="thaumaturgy" data-href="thaumaturgy" href="01-dungeons-and-dragons/cli/spells/thaumaturgy.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Thaumaturgy</a> can unlock doors and unsuccessfully picking the lock, they finally make it into the offices. <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Vladik Shadewrought" data-href="Vladik Shadewrought" href="01-player-characters/vladik-shadewrought.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Vladik</a> first walks over to <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Thaldor Coldforce" data-href="Thaldor Coldforce" href="02-npcs/thaldor-coldforce.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Thaldor</a>'s room and knocks to see if the professor is in. <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Thaldor Coldforce" data-href="Thaldor Coldforce" href="02-npcs/thaldor-coldforce.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Thaldor</a> welcomes <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Vladik Shadewrought" data-href="Vladik Shadewrought" href="01-player-characters/vladik-shadewrought.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Vladik</a>, looking like <a data-href="Ax Tabor" href="02-npcs/ax-tabor.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Ax Tabor</a>, into his office and begins to discuss. <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Vladik Shadewrought" data-href="Vladik Shadewrought" href="01-player-characters/vladik-shadewrought.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Vladik</a> was hoping he was out so he panics and leaves rather quickly.<br>
Deciding they have taken enough risk the pair begin to leave when <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Thaldor Coldforce" data-href="Thaldor Coldforce" href="02-npcs/thaldor-coldforce.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Thaldor</a> exits his office. He then heads down a different hallway which has a single door at the far end. He unlocks the door with what sounds like a very sturdy lock and key and slips inside not letting anyone see past him.<br>Next we are in one of <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Thaldor Coldforce" data-href="Thaldor Coldforce" href="02-npcs/thaldor-coldforce.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Thaldor</a>'s classes where he is trying to teach us about cantrips and magic. He splits us off into 2 groups, casters (Vladik, Fenna, and Orianna) and non-casters (Balgor, Sylva, and Alice). The goal is just to show off what you can do with magic. The caster group does almost nothing with their magic either not working how they intended or not working at all. On the other hand, Alice discovers that she can cast magic innately and moves to join the caster group. <br>The group heads out of the class toward the center of campus, as they walk they are discussing Alice's new revelation. Upon reaching the plaza, the group finds <a data-href="Sylva" href="02-npcs/sylva.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Sylva</a> cornering <a data-href="Brad" href="02-npcs/brad.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Brad</a> and asking about magic and where it comes from. She seems to grow increasingly heated and begins yelling. Suddenly, magic seems to fall off of her and she no longer looks like herself, but like a large <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="goblin-mpmm" data-href="goblin-mpmm" href="01-dungeons-and-dragons/cli/races/goblin-mpmm.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Goblin</a>. The group immediately begins to try to subdue the new foe, who has managed to knock out Brad and is seemingly getting ready to engage with anyone around.<br>
After a short fight with many Magic Missiles from both Vladik and Alice, as well as more goblins appearing from around the area, the first-years manage to take out the backup and restrain the main Goblin for questioning. His name is <a data-href="get-name-from-adam" href=".html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">get-name-from-adam</a> and he was sent here by a <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="frost-giant" data-href="frost-giant" href="01-dungeons-and-dragons/cli/bestiary/giant/frost-giant.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Frost Giant</a> named <a data-href="Vulkara" href="02-npcs/vulkara.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Vulkara</a>. Vulkara is looking for the source of magic she seems to think is located at <a data-href="Cinderwind College" href="03-locations/cinderwind-college.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Cinderwind College</a>. <a data-href="get-name-from-adam" href=".html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">get-name-from-adam</a> does not provide any further information to the group and <a data-href="Alice" href="01-player-characters/alice.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Alice</a> kills him. <br>After the groups close encounter, <a data-href="Arith" href="02-npcs/arith.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Arith</a> arrives on the scene and sees the group of first-years surrounded by dead goblins and an unconscious <a data-href="Brad" href="02-npcs/brad.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Brad</a>. He seems fairly upset by the events he sees and send the students back to their dorm. At the dorm the group decide to look in Sylva's room to see if they find any clues as to where she is. Instead they find Sylva, tied up and gagged on her bed. After making sure that she is okay, they begin to ask her some questions to figure out what happened.<br>
She left campus 2 weeks ago to head home after not having the best first week on campus. On the way, it seems like she was attacked and kidnapped by this group of goblins and thrown in a bag. They brought her back to campus and used her knowledge to disguise themselves as her and go to her classes. She doesn't know much else than that because they kept her hidden away so the group leaves her alone. As they get ready to leave, <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Vladik Shadewrought" data-href="Vladik Shadewrought" href="01-player-characters/vladik-shadewrought.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Vladik</a> notices a bag on her bed and asks if its hers and if he can take a look. She says that's fine, and after picking it up and looking, he realizes he is holding a <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="bag-of-holding" data-href="bag-of-holding" href="01-dungeons-and-dragons/cli/items/bag-of-holding.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Bag of Holding</a>. Vladik, who's goal is to find and study the magic that the campus holds, does not share this knowledge with the group out of concern for relenting the bag. <br>All the first years head to their rooms where they find notes from <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Thaldor Coldforce" data-href="Thaldor Coldforce" href="02-npcs/thaldor-coldforce.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Thaldor</a> commending them on their show of skills today but also warning them to consider their actions before jumping into situations.Summary:: Vladik and Orianna successfully sneak into the faculty offices and snoop around. The first-years are put through their first practical magic class with Thaldor where Alice discovers she is more intune with the weave than she first thought.

<a data-href="Trevalia" href="02-npcs/trevalia.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Trevalia</a> <br>Summary:: Today was the first day of classes. It started with breakfast in the student building, and then a couple hours of free time. We all decided to go out and explore campus which meant we all followed <a data-href="Fenna" href="01-player-characters/fenna.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Fenna</a> to the <a data-href="Chapel" href=".html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Chapel</a>. There we met <a data-href="Brad" href="02-npcs/brad.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Brad</a>, I do not like Brad. What kind of god asks you to worship them while naked, what is the point? The weave does not care about stage of undressed so why should the gods.
The session started with a quick breakfast followed by a 2 hour free period and then our first class, Alchemy.<br>
For the free period, we headed over to the temple because <a data-href="Fenna" href="01-player-characters/fenna.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Fenna</a> needed to take time with her god. We all kind of scoped out the place and then were approached by <a data-href="Brad" href="02-npcs/brad.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Brad</a>. Brad is a typical hippie and patron of the goddess of love. After talking with the gals for a minute he headed over and prayed to his goddess, naked.<br>
From there we headed over to the Wizard and Alchemy tower for our first Alchemy class. In this class we met the professor, [need to get name], and got started on potions. We split up into groups of 2 and each picked a different potion to make. I paired up with <a data-href="Orianna" href="01-player-characters/orianna.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Orianna</a> and we decided to make a <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="potion-of-healing" data-href="potion-of-healing" href="01-dungeons-and-dragons/cli/items/potion-of-healing.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Potion of Healing</a>. We succeeded!
After this, I stuck around the Wizard and Alchemy tower and looked around to see what all was in the building. The first floor was mostly classrooms, the second floor had more classrooms as well as a practice room with dummies for assumedly casting spells on. There was a third floor but it seems to be a single classroom as they had the stairs roped off with a sign that said "Class in Progress".<br>
We then headed over to the lunch hall and had a quick and uneventful lunch from which we headed over to the Student center. We met <a data-href="Soup" href="02-npcs/soup.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Soup</a>, the <a data-href="goblin" href="01-dungeons-and-dragons/cli/bestiary/humanoid/goblin.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">goblin</a> server. He started hooking us up with some drinks before he was interrupted by a 4-th year student <a data-href="need to get name" href=".html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">need to get name</a> who stumbled in drunk and challenged 4 people to beer-pong. The 4 of us took him up on it and got our butt's kicked as everyone but <a data-href="Fenna" href="01-player-characters/fenna.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Fenna</a> proceeded to get drunk. We then slept off our stupor on the bean-bags in the student hall.<br>
We were then awoken by shouts and yelling from the stables. We rush out to help where we find that the animals(a <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="griffon" data-href="griffon" href="01-dungeons-and-dragons/cli/bestiary/monstrosity/griffon.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Griffon</a>, <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="01 - Dungeons and Dragons/CLI/bestiary/legendary-group/unicorn" data-href="01 - Dungeons and Dragons/CLI/bestiary/legendary-group/unicorn" href="01-dungeons-and-dragons/cli/bestiary/legendary-group/unicorn.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Unicorn</a>, <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="owlbear" data-href="owlbear" href="01-dungeons-and-dragons/cli/bestiary/monstrosity/owlbear.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Owlbear</a>, and 3 <a data-href="almiraj" href=".html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">almiraj</a>) have escaped from their pens. ]]></description><link>00-session-notes/session-2.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">01 - Dungeons and Dragons/Campaigns/2025 Campaign/00 - Session Notes/Session 2.md</guid><pubDate>Mon, 28 Jul 2025 20:47:31 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Session 1]]></title><description><![CDATA[

I do not necessarily see the need for such frivoly but I will play the good student and much to my surprise, I like the old man, he has much knowledge and is willing to share it.<br>If this is to be my record of my time here the I will start with getting accepted. I was deep in the forest of <a data-href="Jakunta" href="03-locations/jakunta.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Jakunta</a> hunting for some of the rare spell components that can be found in this uniquely magical forest. While wandering I encountered many <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="blood-hawk" data-href="blood-hawk" href="01-dungeons-and-dragons/cli/bestiary/beast/blood-hawk.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Blood Hawk</a>s in the area and was very wary of attacks from the sky, I think that is why I noticed the bird straight away. He dove out of the sky with letter clamped in talon, I took the note from bird and sent it on its way. Havin received my admission letter, my plan could begin. I immediately turned toward the direct of school and started my long journey.<br>Many days later I arrived on campus, fortunately on very first day of school. Approaching such a creation of foot is a wonder to behold, the entire campus floating in the air suspended by magic that has been lost for so long. Once on grounds, I was led to the <a data-href="Dorms" href=".html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Dorms</a>, which also house the <a data-href="Dinning Hall" href=".html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Dinning Hall</a>, and was sat at the first year table, where I was slowly introduced to my new companions. I do not remember who came in when, but slowly all of my fellows took their seats at the table with me. <a data-href="Gregor" href="02-npcs/gregor.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Gregor</a> and I kept mostly to ourselves but we did make note of the large <a data-href="dragonborn" href="01-dungeons-and-dragons/cli/races/dragonborn.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">dragonborn</a>, I now know that to be <a data-href="Balgor" href="02-npcs/balgor.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Balgor</a>, who sat next to us. <a data-href="Sylva" href="02-npcs/sylva.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Sylva</a> did try to start up some conversation but none of us were much for it. <br>As dinner came to an end, we new students were asked to stay behind, as everyone left, for some ground rules and introductions. After the hall emptied out except for <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Thaldor Coldforce" data-href="Thaldor Coldforce" href="02-npcs/thaldor-coldforce.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Thaldor</a>, he started to give us some basic introductions and guidelines of life here. However, he suddenly gasped and looked up into the rafters of the room. We all turned to see what he was looking at. I have seen some large spiders in my day, this made those look reasonable. The spider dropped down from the rafters and landed on a table in the center of the room. We immediately started trying to dispatch the creature but did have some struggles with doing so. I'm not proud to say that I spend a large portion of the fight caught in some web it threw my way. I did notice one of my new friends, <a data-href="Orianna" href="01-player-characters/orianna.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Orianna</a>, snuck off and managed to pick the entry door. I will have to keep these skills in mind for some... future needs.<br><a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Thaldor Coldforce" data-href="Thaldor Coldforce" href="02-npcs/thaldor-coldforce.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Thaldor</a> appeared back in the room and calmed the spider before we fully killed it, apparently this is some type of hazing that they do for all new students. I don't know how I feel about that but it is good to know we will be expected to overcome challenges on our own, might make the staff look the other way to students taking matters into their own hands. <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Thaldor Coldforce" data-href="Thaldor Coldforce" href="02-npcs/thaldor-coldforce.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Thaldor</a> then finished up his introduction by telling us we will face many challenges like this during our time here at the school and he looks forward to us finding our way here at <a data-href="Cinderwind College" href="03-locations/cinderwind-college.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Cinderwind College</a>.Finally I was able to leave the dinning hall and we were shown to our new quarters for our residency. They were nothing special but they are a great deal better than sleeping under a tree or rock ledge. Gregor, damn the softy, immediatly settled in and got comfortable. I will have to make sure he does not slack too much. On the bed in my room I did find an envelope with some interesting tokens inside. However, as i poured them out into my hand they immediately seemed to evaporate. As they did so, I felt my connection to the weave strengthen. I immediately tried to cast one of the spells I had been experimenting with and found that where it had previously been failing, it now could sustain itself and form succesfully. I am very intrigued to see what is going on at this school and to find what secrets it is hiding.Summary:: In this session, the character reflects on their acceptance into Cinderwind College, detailing their arrival on campus, an introduction dinner where they encountered a giant spider as part of a hazing ritual, and the discovery of a mysterious envelope that enhances their magical abilities.

They respect only brute strength and skill in battle, demonstrating both with their scars and the grisly trophies they take from their enemies.Frost giants are creatures of ice and snow. Their hair and beards are pale white or light blue, matted with frost and clattering with icicles. Their flesh is as blue as glacial ice.Frost giants dwell in high peaks and glacial rifts where the sun hides its golden head by winter. Crops don't grow in their frozen homelands, and they keep little livestock beyond what they capture in their raids against civilized lands. They hunt the wild game of the tundra and mountains but don't cook it, since meat from a fresh kill tastes sufficiently hot to their palate.The war horns of the frost giants howl as they march from their ice fortresses and glacial rifts amid the howling blizzard. When that storm clears, villages and steadings lay in ruins, ravens descending to feed on the corpses of any creatures foolish or unlucky enough to stand in the giants' path.Inns and taverns suffer the brunt of the damage, their cellars gutted and their casks of ale and mead gone. Smithies are likewise toppled, their iron and steel claimed. Curiously undisturbed are the houses of moneylenders and wealthy citizens, for the reavers have little use for coins or baubles. Frost giants prize gems and jewelry large enough to be worn and noticed. However, even those treasures are most often saved for trading opportunities with other giants more adept at crafting metal weapons and armor.Frost giants respect brute strength above all else, and a frost giant's place in the ordning depends on evidence of physical might, such as superior musculature, scars from battles of renown, or trophies fashioned from the bodies of slain enemies. Tasks such as hunting, childrearing, and crafting are given to giants based on their physical strength and hardiness.When frost giants of different clans meet and their status is unclear, they wrestle for dominance. Such meetings might resemble festivals where giants cheer on their champions, making bold boasts and challenges. At other times, the informal ceremony can become a chaotic free-for-all where both clans rush into a melee that fells trees, shatters the ice on frozen lakes, and causes avalanches on the snowy mountainsides.Though frost giants consider the menial crafting of goods beneath them, carving and leatherwork are valued skills. They make their clothing from the skins and bones of beasts, and carve bone or ivory into jewelry and the handles of weapons and tools. They reuse the weapons and armor of their smaller foes, stringing shields into scale armor and lashing sword blades to wooden hafts to make giant-sized spears. The greatest battle trophies come from conquered dragons, and the greatest frost giant jarls wear armor of dragon scales or wield picks and mauls made of a dragon's teeth or claws.Ancient empires once cast long shadows over a world that quaked beneath the giants' feet. In those lost days, these towering figures were dragon slayers, dreamers, crafters, and kings, but their kind fell from glory long ago. However, even divided among secluded clans scattered throughout the world, the giants maintain the customs and traditions of old.In remote regions of the world, the last remaining plinths, monoliths, and statues of the great giant empires bow their heads in desolate obscurity. Where once those empires sprawled across all lands, now the giants dwell in isolated tribes and clans.Giants are almost as old as dragons, which were still young when the giants' heavy feet first shook the foundations of the world. As they spread across new lands, giants and dragons fought bitter generational wars that nearly brought both sides low. No living giant remembers what started the conflict, but myths and tales of their race's glorious dawn are still sung in their steadings and holdfasts, vilifying the primeval wyrms. Giants and dragons continue to harbor grudges against one another, and it is seldom that they will meet or occupy the same area without a fight.Each of the main giant races-the cloud, fire, frost, hill, stone, and storm giants-are related by common elements of history, religion, and culture. They view one another as kindred, keeping any inherent animosity over territory and ambition to a minimum.Giants belong to a caste structure called the ordning. Based on social class and highly organized, the ordning assigns a social rank to each giant. By understanding its place in the ordning, a giant knows which other giants are inferior or superior to it, since no two giants are equal. Each of the giant races analyzes a different combination of skills or qualities to determine the ordning. Giants make excelling in these qualities the purpose of their lives.At the highest level of the ordning, the races of the giants are also ranked according to status. Storm giants are the highest in the ordning, followed by cloud giants, fire giants, frost giants, stone giants, hill giants, and finally giant kin such as fomorians, ettins, and ogres.Regardless of a giant's rank among its own race, the chief of a hill giant tribe is inferior to the most common of stone giants. The lowest ranked giant of any type is superior to the highest ranked giant of an inferior type. It isn't considered evil to disrespect or even betray a giant of another type, merely rude.Giant Gods
When the giants' ancient empires fell, Annam, father of all giants, forsook his children and the world. He swore never to look upon either again until the giants had returned to their glory and reclaimed their birthright as rulers of the world. As a result, giants pray not to Annam but to his divine children, along with a host of hero-deities and godly villains that make up the giants' pantheon.
Chief among these gods are the children of Annam, whose sons represent each type of giant: Stronmaus for storm giants, Memnor for cloud giants, Skoraeus Stonebones for stone giants, Thrym for frost giants, Surtur for fire giants, and Grolantor for hill giants. Not all giants automatically revere their kind's primary deity, however. Many good cloud giants refuse to worship the deceitful Memnor, and a storm giant dwelling in the icy mountains of the north might pay more homage to Thrym than Stronmaus. Other giants feel a stronger connection to Annam's daughters, who include Hiatea, the huntress and home warden; Iallanis, goddess of love and peace; and Diancastra, an impetuous and arrogant trickster.
Some giants abandon their own gods and fall prey to demon cults, paying homage to Baphomet or Kostchtchie. To worship them or any other non-giant deity is a great sin against the ordning, and almost certain to make a giant an outcast. A quote from Captain Dwern Addlestone's partial account of the Siege of Sterngate Boulders assailed our walls and cast them down, leavin' gaps through which the giants strode, weapons in hand.
A quote from Elder Zelane of Istivin, recounting the Giant Wars And here is where Angerroth the barbarian fell against the giant horde. His bones are under that boulder over there.

Source: Monster Manual p. 241, Curse of Strahd. Available in the SRD A black pudding resembles a heaving mound of sticky black sludge. In dim passageways, the pudding appears to be little more than a blot of shadow.Flesh, wood, metal, and bone dissolve when the pudding ebbs over them. Stone remains behind, wiped clean.Oozes thrive in the dark, shunning areas of bright light and extreme temperatures. They flow through the damp underground, feeding on any creature or object that can be dissolved, slinking along the ground, dripping from walls and ceilings, spreading across the edges of underground pools, and squeezing through cracks.The first warning an adventurer receives of an ooze's presence is often the searing pain of its acidic touch. Oozes are drawn to movement and warmth. Organic material nourishes them, and when prey is scarce they feed on grime, fungus, and offal. Veteran explorers know that an immaculately clean passageway is a likely sign that an ooze lairs nearby.An ooze kills its prey slowly. Some varieties, such as black puddings and gelatinous cubes, engulf creatures to prevent escape. The only upside of this torturous death is that a victim's comrades can come to the rescue before it is too late.Since not every ooze digests every type of substance, some have coins, metal gear, bones, and other debris suspended within their quivering bodies. A slain ooze can be a rich source of treasure for its killers.Whether this is true or not, the Faceless Lord is one of the few beings that can control oozes and imbue them with a modicum of intelligence. Most of the time, oozes have no sense of tactics or self-preservation. They are direct and predictable, attacking and eating without cunning. Under the control of Juiblex, they exhibit glimmers of sentience and malevolent intent.Although an ooze lacks the intelligence to ally itself with other creatures, others that understand an ooze's need to feed might lure it into a location where it can be of use to them. Clever monsters keep oozes around to defend passageways or consume refuse. Likewise, an ooze can be enticed into a pit trap, where its captors feed it often enough to prevent it from coming after them. Crafty creatures place torches and flaming braziers in strategic areas to dissuade an ooze from leaving a particular tunnel or room.According to the Demonomicon of Iggwilv and other sources, oozes are scattered fragments or offspring of the demon lord Juiblex.An ooze doesn't require sleep.underdarkblack-pudding

Unless it is uprooted and burned while it is still a seedling, the corpse flower grows to enormous size over several weeks, then tears itself free of the earth and begins scavenging Humanoid corpses from battlefields and graveyards. Using its fibrous tentacles, it stuffs the remains into its body to sustain and repair itself. The plant has a malevolent bent and despises the living.With or without corpses nested in its body, a corpse flower exudes a stench of decay that can overwhelm the senses of nearby creatures, causing them to become nauseated.

It exists only to consume, digesting and transforming living matter into more of itself.A true horror, Juiblex is a mass of bubbling slime, swirling black and green, with glaring red eyes floating and shifting within it. It can rise up like a 20-foot hill, lashing out with dripping pseudopods to drag victims into its bulk. Those consumed by Juiblex are obliterated.Note

Nothing deep but definitely willing to sit and grab a beer with her as the time allowed. Afterall, something has to make the time at <a data-href="Cinderwind College" href="03-locations/cinderwind-college.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Cinderwind College</a> bearable. They very generally pass around the idea of breaking into the faculty offices to see what they are hiding there. Vladik knows he has a plan but doesn't want to worry Orianna.<br>
In addition to this, he also tries to get to know the new teacher this year <a data-href="Mirabelle" href=".html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Mirabelle</a>. He has already seen she is willing to talk about the secrets of the school, maybe he can get more out of her.
Finally, while Vladik is not concerned with the school itself or what if stands for, he is blown away at the progress he has already made and wants to get to the bottom of how the school is able to advance people abilities so far beyond what is normally achievable. He can be seen around campus and in the dorms at time deep in a book or writing notes to himself in his journal. Vla
Occasionally he plays fetch with Gregor. Gregor doesn't know why he loves it but he does.]]></description><link>00-session-notes/session-2.5.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">01 - Dungeons and Dragons/Campaigns/2025 Campaign/00 - Session Notes/Session 2.5.md</guid><pubDate>Mon, 17 Mar 2025 12:48:29 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
